# Changelog

## 2.45.0

### Minor Changes

- 624c15d: Switch to using default imports for libraries imported in gateway

## 2.44.0

### Minor Changes

- 3a3c092: # Add support for abort signals

  The [AbortSignal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) interface represents a signal object that allows you to communicate with an asynchronous operation (such as a fetch request) and abort it if required via an AbortController object. All gateway APIs (Fetch, HTTP and XHR) support this interface via the `signal` parameter:

  ```javascript
  const abortController = new AbortController()
  // Start a long running task...
  client.Bitcoin.mine({ signal: abortController.signal })
  // This takes too long, abort!
  abortController.abort()
  ```

  # Minor type fixes

  The return value of some functions on `Request` have been updated to highlight that they might return undefined:

  - `Request#body()`
  - `Request#auth()`
  - `Request#timeout()`

  The reasoning behind this change is that if you didn't pass them (and no middleware set them) they might simply be undefined. So the types were simply wrong before. If you experience a "breaking change" due to this change, then it means you have a potential bug that you didn't properly handle before.

## 2.43.1

### Patch Changes

- 0177911: Fixes `middlewares` import path

## 2.43.0

### Minor Changes

- 6e94f97: Bundle with ESM exports.

  - The recommended way to use mappersmith in ESM projects is to do `import { forge } from 'mappersmith'` rather than the old `import forge from 'mappersmith'`. The reason is because test runners like jest and vitest might get confused when mixing named/default exports together with ESM, even though tsc and node has no problems with it.
  - A similar recommendation change goes for importing middleware: do `import { EncodeJsonMiddleware } from 'mappersmith/middleware'` (note the `mappersmith/middleware` folder) rather than deep import `import EncodeJsonMiddleware from 'mappersmith/middleware/encode-json'`. We still support the old import, but it will be deprecated in the future.
  - The same recommendation goes for importing gateway: do `import { FetchGateway } from 'mappersmith/gateway'` (note the `mappersmith/gateway` folder) rather than deep import `import FetchGateway from 'mappersmith/gateway/fetch'`. We still support the old import, but it will be deprecated in the future.
